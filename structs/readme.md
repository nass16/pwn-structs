## Status

This project is a work in progress. I'll add more structs as soon as possible.

The structs will be always updated to ensure they are compatible with the latest game version.

If you don't know what structs are then I will explain it as simply as possible: structs is a simple structure / logic for a specific feature eg. no recoil uses specific offsets, functions and my structs will help you as much as possible and will explain on how to make a working no recoil code.
